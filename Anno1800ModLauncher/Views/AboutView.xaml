            This mod launcher is a passion project that I felt the Anno Community deserved. I myself prefer mod launchers that are focused on one 
            specific game as they usually are able to address concerns regarding that game more quickly and efficiently. I noticed that the mod community around this game 
            has created some pretty awesome mods, and xforce was extremely kind enough to create an awesome mod loader that works extremely well. The only piece of the puzzle left 
            was a Mod Loader that brought all of it together in an easy to use tool.

            I'm a gamer myself and have been playing Anno games for years. On top of that, I'm a married father with a full time job, so my time is precious to me and those around me.
            I created this out of love and passion for programming so I appreciate that you took the time to check it out. Please feel free to make suggestions, comments, or even make the 
            occasional gripe over on the official discord for 
            this app: <LineBreak /><Hyperlink NavigateUri="https://discord.gg/QuHNrCc" RequestNavigate="Hyperlink_RequestNavigate">Anno 1800 Mod Launcher Discord Server</Hyperlink><LineBreak />
